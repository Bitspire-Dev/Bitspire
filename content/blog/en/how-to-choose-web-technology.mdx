## TL;DR

Choose a technology that minimizes risk for **goals, team, budget, and timeline**. For most projects in 2025, the best default choice is Next.js + TypeScript.

## Step 1: Define Your Project Shape

* **Goal:** marketing, e-commerce, SaaS, internal application?
* **Traffic:** hundreds, thousands, millions of users?
* **Time:** days, weeks, months?
* **Team:** junior/senior, in-house/agency?
* **Budget:** build + maintenance?

## Step 2: Choose a Rendering Model

* **SSG** (static): fastest for content
* **SSR**: better SEO and dynamic data
* **CSR**: good for dashboards
* **Hybrid**: best for real projects

## Step 3: Match Stack to Goal

### Website / Blog

* Next.js + MDX + headless CMS
* Astro + MDX

### E-commerce

* Next.js + Shopify / Medusa
* Nuxt + Shopware

### SaaS

* Next.js + Supabase
* Remix + Prisma

## Decision Matrix (Example)

| Criteria     | Next.js | React + Vite | Astro |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------ | ----- |
| SEO          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Speed        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| DX           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| Content      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Applications | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐    |

## Checklist

* Do you need SSR/SSG?
* Is SEO critical?
* Does the team know the stack?
* Does the stack have good long-term support?

## Minimal Example (Next.js)

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome, 2025</h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-slate-300">Fast, SEO, production-ready.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Recommendation

If you're not sure — **Next.js + TypeScript** is the best compromise.

* Static Site Generation (SSG)
* Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
* Automatic image optimization
* Built-in routing

**Gatsby** works great for:

* Static sites with lots of content
* Blogs and corporate websites
* Projects requiring ultra-fast loading

### 3. Developer Experience

Choose technologies that:

* Have an active community
* Have good documentation
* Are supported by large companies or foundations
* Have a rich ecosystem of tools

## Popular Technology Stacks in 2025

### Stack #1: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Best for:** Most web projects, business applications, e-commerce

**Advantages:**

* Great performance thanks to SSR/SSG
* Excellent SEO
* TypeScript provides type safety
* Tailwind speeds up development

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">
        Welcome to Next.js 15!
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Stack #2: React + Vite + shadcn/ui

**Best for:** Single Page Applications, dashboards, internal applications

**Advantages:**

* Lightning-fast development thanks to Vite
* Full control over routing
* shadcn/ui provides ready-made components
* Great DX

### Stack #3: Astro + MDX

**Best for:** Content-heavy websites, blogs, documentation

**Advantages:**

* Ultra-fast loading (zero JS by default)
* Partial hydration
* Supports components from different frameworks
* Ideal for static content

## Red Flags - What to Avoid

❌ **Don't choose technology just because it's "hot"**

* Trendy doesn't always mean right for your case

❌ **Don't overestimate your abilities**

* A stack you don't know means longer development time

❌ **Don't ignore maintainability**

* In a year, you'll have to maintain all of this

❌ **Don't forget about the team**

* The best technology is the one your team knows

## Questions You Must Ask Yourself

1. **Do I need SSR?**
   * If SEO is critical → Next.js, Nuxt
   * If not → React/Vue SPA
2. **How big will the application be?**
   * Small/medium → Next.js, Astro
   * Large enterprise → Next.js with monorepo
3. **Will content change frequently?**
   * Yes → CMS (Tina, Sanity) + Next.js
   * No → Static site (Astro, Gatsby)
4. **What's my team like?**
   * JavaScript developers → React ecosystem
   * Mixed → Framework with good documentation

## Our Recommendations for 2025

### For small projects:

**Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS + Vercel**

* Quick start
* Minimal configuration
* Free hosting on Vercel

### For medium projects:

**Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Tina CMS + PostgreSQL**

* Type safety
* Headless CMS
* Scalability
* Professional maintenance

### For large enterprise:

**Next.js + TypeScript + Monorepo (Turborepo) + Prisma + PostgreSQL**

* Code sharing
* Scalability
* Team collaboration
* Long-term maintainability

## Summary

Technology choice is a balance between:

* **Project requirements** vs **team capabilities**
* **Performance** vs **development speed**
* **Modernity** vs **stability**

There's no one universal solution. The key is understanding the specifics of your project and making an informed decision based on facts, not trends.
