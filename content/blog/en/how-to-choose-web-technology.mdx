## TL;DR

Pick the stack that minimizes risk for your **goal, team, budget, and timeline**. Use SSR/SSG for marketing sites, choose full‑stack frameworks for product apps, and avoid over‑engineering for MVPs.

## Step 1: Define the project shape

Answer these first:

- **Goal:** marketing, e‑commerce, SaaS, internal tool?
- **Traffic:** hundreds, thousands, or millions of users?
- **Time to market:** days, weeks, or months?
- **Team:** in‑house vs agency; junior vs senior?
- **Budget:** build cost + long‑term maintenance?

## Step 2: Choose the rendering model

- **SSG** (static): fastest for content‑heavy sites.
- **SSR** (server rendering): best for dynamic SEO pages.
- **CSR** (client): good for dashboards and apps.
- **Hybrid**: most real projects need a mix.

## Step 3: Match stacks to outcomes

### Marketing site / blog
- Next.js + MDX + headless CMS
- Astro + MDX

### E‑commerce
- Next.js + Shopify / Medusa
- Nuxt + Shopware

### SaaS
- Next.js + Supabase
- Remix + Prisma

### Internal tools
- React + Vite
- Vue + Vite

## Decision matrix (example)

| Criterion | Next.js | React + Vite | Astro |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEO | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| DX | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Content sites | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Apps | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Do you need SSR/SSG?
- [ ] Are you SEO‑driven?
- [ ] Do you need built‑in routing, middleware, auth?
- [ ] Can your team support this stack long‑term?

## Example: minimal Next.js app

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, 2025</h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-slate-300">
        Fast, SEO‑friendly, production‑ready.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Recommendation

If you’re unsure, start with **Next.js + TypeScript**. It’s the most future‑proof, has the best ecosystem, and scales with the product.
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in routing

**Gatsby** works great for:
- Static sites with lots of content
- Blogs and corporate websites
- Projects requiring ultra-fast loading

### 3. Developer Experience

Choose technologies that:

- Have an active community
- Have good documentation
- Are supported by large companies or foundations
- Have a rich ecosystem of tools

## Popular Tech Stacks in 2025

### Stack #1: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Best for:** Most web projects, business applications, e-commerce

**Advantages:**
- Great performance thanks to SSR/SSG
- Excellent SEO
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Tailwind speeds up development

**Example usage:**
```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">
        Welcome to Next.js 15!
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Stack #2: React + Vite + shadcn/ui

**Best for:** Single Page Applications, dashboards, internal apps

**Advantages:**
- Lightning-fast development thanks to Vite
- Full control over routing
- shadcn/ui provides ready-made components
- Great DX

### Stack #3: Astro + MDX

**Best for:** Content-heavy websites, blogs, documentation

**Advantages:**
- Ultra-fast loading (zero JS by default)
- Partial hydration
- Supports components from different frameworks
- Perfect for static content

## Red Flags - What to Avoid

❌ **Don't choose technology just because it's "hot"**
- Trendy doesn't always mean suitable for your case

❌ **Don't overestimate your capabilities**
- A stack you don't know means longer development time

❌ **Don't ignore maintainability**
- In a year, you'll have to maintain it all

❌ **Don't forget about the team**
- The best technology is the one your team knows

## Questions You Must Ask Yourself

1. **Do I need SSR?**
   - If SEO is critical → Next.js, Nuxt
   - If not → React/Vue SPA

2. **How large will the application be?**
   - Small/medium → Next.js, Astro
   - Large enterprise → Next.js with monorepo

3. **Will content change frequently?**
   - Yes → CMS (Tina, Sanity) + Next.js
   - No → Static site (Astro, Gatsby)

4. **What team do I have?**
   - JavaScript developers → React ecosystem
   - Mixed → Framework with good documentation

## Summary

Technology choice is a balance between:
- **Project requirements** vs **team capabilities**
- **Performance** vs **development speed**
- **Modernity** vs **stability**

There's no one universal solution. The key is understanding your project's specifics and making an informed decision based on facts, not trends.
