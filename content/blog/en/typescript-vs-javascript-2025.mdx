## Introduction

In the world of web development, there's an ongoing debate: TypeScript or JavaScript? In 2025, TypeScript has reached 85% adoption among large projects, but does this mean JavaScript has lost its value?

## TypeScript - What Is It?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which allows catching errors at the coding stage.


**1. Catching Errors During Development**

```typescript
// TypeScript will catch the error before running
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

addNumbers(5, "10"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
```

**2. Better IDE Support**

- Autocomplete
- IntelliSense
- Jump to definition

**3. Self-Documenting Code**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

**4. Easier Teamwork**

TypeScript reduces the risk of communication errors in teams through clearly defined API contracts.


For beginner programmers, TypeScript can be overwhelming. You need to learn:
- Type system

**2. Additional Overhead**

- More time for project setup
- Need for compilation
- Additional configuration files (tsconfig.json)

**3. Not Always Necessary**

Small projects or prototypes often don't require TypeScript.

## JavaScript - Still Relevant?

### JavaScript Advantages

**1. Simplicity and Speed**

- No configuration
- Immediate execution
- Ideal for prototypes

**2. Flexibility**

JavaScript allows for quick iterations and experiments without type constraints.

**3. Smaller Bundle Size**

No transpilation means smaller output files.

### JavaScript Disadvantages

**1. Runtime Errors**

Errors only appear during application execution.

**2. Harder Refactoring**

Lack of types makes safe refactoring of large codebases difficult.

## When to Choose TypeScript?

✅ **Large projects** - over 10,000 lines of code
✅ **Team work** - more than 3 programmers
✅ **Enterprise applications**
✅ **Long-term projects**
✅ **API-intensive applications**

## When Is JavaScript Enough?

✅ **Small projects** - under 5,000 lines of code
✅ **Prototypes and MVP**
✅ **Personal projects**
✅ **Scripts and tools**
✅ **Landing pages**

## Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript

If you decide to migrate, do it gradually:

**Step 1: Add TypeScript to the project**

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react
```

**Step 2: Create tsconfig.json**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": false, // Enable later
    "allowJs": true // Allow both JS and TS
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Migrate File by File**

Change extensions from `.js` to `.ts` gradually, starting with the most critical modules.

## Summary

In 2025, **TypeScript is the standard for large projects**, but **JavaScript still works great for small applications**. The choice depends on:

- Project size
- Team size
- Project lifespan
- Team experience

Our recommendation? **Start with TypeScript for new medium and large projects**. For small projects, JavaScript may be sufficient.
