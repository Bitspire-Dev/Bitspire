## TL;DR

TypeScript is the better default for long‑term projects. JavaScript is fine for small prototypes or quick experiments.

## What TypeScript really adds

- Static types and safer refactors
- Better IDE autocomplete
- Clearer contracts between modules

```typescript
type User = { id: string; email: string };

function sendEmail(user: User) {
  return `Hello ${user.email}`;
}
```

## When TypeScript wins

- Medium/large codebases
- Multi‑developer teams
- Long‑term maintenance

## When JavaScript is OK

- MVPs or quick demos
- Very small projects
- One‑off scripts

## Migration path

1) Add `tsconfig.json`
2) Rename files `.ts/.tsx`
3) Fix types gradually

```bash
pnpm add -D typescript @types/node @types/react
```

## Recommendation

If you plan to maintain the project for more than 6 months — go with **TypeScript**.

**2. Better IDE Support**

- Autocomplete
- IntelliSense
- Refactoring tools
- Jump to definition

**3. Self-documenting Code**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest';
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

**4. Easier Team Collaboration**

TypeScript reduces communication errors in teams through clearly defined API contracts.

### TypeScript Disadvantages

**1. Learning Curve**

For beginners, TypeScript can be overwhelming. You need to learn:
- Type system
- Interfaces and types
- Generics
- Utility types

**2. Additional Overhead**

- More time for project setup
- Compilation required
- Additional config files (tsconfig.json)

**3. Not Always Necessary**

Small projects or prototypes often don't require TypeScript.

## JavaScript - Still Relevant?

### JavaScript Advantages

**1. Simplicity and Speed**

- No configuration needed
- Instant execution
- Ideal for prototypes

**2. Flexibility**

JavaScript allows quick iterations and experiments without type constraints.

**3. Smaller Bundle Size**

No transpilation means smaller output files.

### JavaScript Disadvantages

**1. Runtime Errors**

Errors only surface when the application runs.

**2. Harder Refactoring**

Lack of types makes safe refactoring of large codebases difficult.

## When to Choose TypeScript?

✅ **Large projects** - over 10,000 lines of code
✅ **Team work** - more than 3 developers
✅ **Enterprise applications**
✅ **Long-term projects**
✅ **API-intensive applications**

## When JavaScript is Enough?

✅ **Small projects** - under 5,000 lines of code
✅ **Prototypes and MVPs**
✅ **Personal projects**
✅ **Scripts and tools**
✅ **Landing pages**

## Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript

If you decide to migrate, do it gradually:

**Step 1: Add TypeScript to Project**

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react
```

**Step 2: Create tsconfig.json**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": false, // Enable later
    "allowJs": true // Allow both JS and TS
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Migrate File by File**

Change extensions from `.js` to `.ts` gradually, starting with the most critical modules.

## Summary

In 2025, **TypeScript is the standard for large projects**, but **JavaScript still works great for small applications**. Choice depends on:

- Project size
- Team size
- Project lifespan
- Team experience

Our recommendation? **Start with TypeScript in new medium and large projects**. For small projects, JavaScript may suffice.
